        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h5>
      <p>
        The first thing I paid attention to upon clicking this link is
        Luniverse’s cute pastel colours, the miniature 3D models and the way the
        mouse was able to move the world in such an unique way. Whenever I
        hovered my mouse over these 3D islands, the 3D objects would float up in
        a cheerful manner which was mesmerising to watch.

        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h5>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          I played with the soccer ball and tried to shoot it in the goal
          multiple times.
        </li>
        <li>
          I tried shooting the basketball into the hoop and clicking the
          basketball up high.
        </li>
        <li>Checked the info for their Omada app.</li>
        <li>
          Looked over the buttons on the side and the options they provide.
        </li>
        <li>Hovered over the studio world.</li>

        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h5>
      <p>
        I noticed that I spent the most time trying to shoot the soccer ball. It
        was satisfying when you shot the ball and a bunch of coins would burst
        out of the goal. Another part of the experience I was engaging with was
        the basketball by testing the limits of how high it can go by clicking
        it multiple times.

        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h5>
      <p>
        The most common action in my two minute interaction consisted of me
        maneuvering through the worlds and hovering my mouse to move the screen.
        Since this website incorporated a lot of 3D assets, I could not help but
        try to click on any 3D objects to see if there were any interactions and
        there were many that did nothing.

          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Based on my impression for the intended purpose, I think that this is
          a very creative way to promote an app and look for potential workers.
          The intended purpose of the Luniverse is mainly to scope out for
          creative individuals to hire. With the experience that the website
          provided, it made me more compelled in looking through their available
          positions due to how fun it was to interact with the different assets
          in the website. This fun experience allows users to spend longer on
          the website and feel more compelled to browse around to find other fun
          activities.

          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h5>
        <p>
          They communicate their primary goal of finding creative applicants by
          showing their love for design and learning, whilst stating that they
          thrive for endless creativity. Through their use of 3D assets and
          interesting UI design, it demonstrates their love for design and
          creativity whilst valuing their employees’ skillsets.

        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Based on my impression, I believe that the experience intends for the
        user to have fun with the 3D assets whilst you go through the
        information which could take up to 1-3 minutes. I believe that playing
        with 3D models like soccer, basketball, eggs in a pan and punching bag
        would be interacted with for 2 minutes each or less, everytime you come
        across it. Longer times will probably be spent on reading the main
        information eg. Omada app, careers, positions, their mission and their
        drive to push creativity and diversity. This website is intended for
        repeated visits to pull in users who are seeking for a creative job
        through small and fun interactions.

        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The overall interactive experience does not encourage repeated visits as
        there is no progress checking or saved history, unless there was someone
        interested in a working position. The 3D models are the main displays on the
        screen whilst on the side, there will be buttons situated at the side which
        prompts the users to click on them. I believe that the designers of this
        website want the users to be immersed in this world and interact with
        different items and eventually stumble upon the informational tabs. The
        main information on this website is seen as an afterthought compared to
        its appealing visuals to ensure that users spend longer on the website,
        admiring its cute visuals.

        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The other forms of media that the experience reminds me of AIRBNB
        advertisements/TV commercials that involve miniature 3D models and the
        same high angle. This website also reminds me of 3D assets that are
        used in mobile games like monument valley and dancing line, from its
        overly simple textures and low poly texture.

        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Based on the visuals sharing similarities to various mobile games, this
        encourages people who like the addictive nature of mobile games to keep
        playing and keep browsing through the 3D assets like a puzzle. Personally, I feel
        free in how I interact with this experience, enabling me to have fun in this space. 
        I am able to have fun and try to find different things to click on 3D models and 
        more buttons to see where it will take me. Animations are open to just admire
        and observe in how they animate different objects.

        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The space is calming and relaxing from its use of various purples to create a
        dreamy atmosphere, intended to make users feel welcomed and
        accepted. The visuals that derive other mobile games like monument
        valley and dancing line allows for users to be comfortable and more
        familiar in how they interact with the environment, thus enhancing their
        experience and enjoyment. It can also increase their time on the website due 
        to its addictive nature.

            12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
            </h5>
          <p>
            The most frustrating part of the interaction was not knowing where to where to click sometimes because 
            of how they emphasised focus onto the visuals. I also noticed that when I used the the mouse scroll wheel, 
            it would abruptly skip onto the next world and I never knew where I was going. I thought that by using 
            the scroll wheel, I would be able to zoom in the 3D islands but it instead proceeds onto the next page. 
            Also, the important buttons were situated at the side, which is not too noticeable compared to the cute
            visuals so it would be nice if they incorporated it into their 3D world more naturally and more noticeable.

            13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
          </h5>
          <p>
            The most satisfying part of the experience was the feeling of satisifaction and achievement when the coins
            erupt after you shoot the ball into the goal. Moreover, the mouse interaction with the floating island had
            a smooth animation and was fun to maneuver. Lastly, the scrolling mechanic where small bits of information
            and words pop out whether you scroll down was a nice detail. Personally, it made the information more 
            digestible and made my experience more satisfying.
