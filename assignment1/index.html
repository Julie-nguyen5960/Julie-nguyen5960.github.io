    <p class="subheadings"> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>

    <p> The first thing I paid attention to upon clicking this link is Luniverse's cute pastel colours, the miniature 3D models and the way the mouse was able to move the world in such an unique way. Whenever I hovered my mouse over these 3D islands, the 3D objects would float up in a cheerful manner which was mesmerising to watch.</p>

    <p class="subheadings">2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions. </p>

    <ul class="list">
      
    <li> 1. I played with the soccer ball and tried to shoot it in the goal multiple times</li>
    <li> 2. I tried shooting the basketball into the hoop and clicking the basketball up high</li>
    <li> 3. Checked the info for their Omada app</li>
    <li> 4. Looked over the buttons on the side and the options they provide.</li>
    <li> 5. Hover over the studio world</li>
   </ul>

  <p class="subheadings"> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>

  <p>I noticed that I spent the most time trying to shoot the soccer ball. It was satisfying when you shot the ball and a bunch of coins would burst out of the goal. Another part of the experience I was engaging with was the basketball by testing the limits of how high it can go by clicking it multiple times. </p>

  <p class="subheadings"> 4. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>

  <P>The most common action in my two minute interaction consisted of me maneuvering through the worlds and hovering my mouse to move the screen. Since this website incorporated a lot of 3D assets, I could not help but try to click on any 3D objects to see if there were any interactions and there were many that did nothing. </P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>

  <P>Based on my impression for the intended purpose, I think that this is a very creative way to promote an app and look for potential workers. The intended purpose of the Luniverse is mainly to scope out for creative individuals to hire. With the experience that the website provided, it made me more compelled in looking through their available positions due to how fun it was to interact with the different assets in the website. This fun experience allows users to spend longer on the website and feel more compelled to browse around to find other fun activities.</P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>

  <P>They communicate their primary goal of finding creative applicants by showing their love for design and learning, whilst stating that they thrive for endless creativity. Through their use of 3D assets and interesting UI design, it demonstrates their love for design and creativity whilst valuing their employees’ skillsets. </P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>

  <P>Based on my impression, I believe that the experience intends for the user to have fun with the 3D assets whilst you go through the information which could take up to 1-3 minutes. I believe that playing with 3D models like soccer, basketball, eggs in a pan and punching bag would be interacted with for 2 minutes each or less, everytime you come across it. Longer times will probably be spent on reading the main information eg. Omada app, careers, positions, their mission and their drive to push creativity and diversity. This website is intended for repeated visits to pull in users who are seeking for a creative job through small and fun interactions.</P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</p>

  <P>The overall interactive experience does not encourage repeated visits as there is no progress checking or saved history, unless someone was interested in a position.  The 3D models are the main displays on the screen but on the side, there will be buttons situated at the side which prompts the users to click on them. I believe that the designers of this website want the users to be immersed in this world and interact with different items and eventually stumble upon the informational tabs. The main information on this website is seen as an afterthought compared to its appealing visuals to ensure that users spend longer on the website, admiring its cute visuals. </P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>

   <P>The other forms of media that the experience reminds me of AIRBNB advertisements/TV commercials that involve miniature 3D models and the same high angle. This website also reminds me of 3D assets that you would use in mobile games like monument valley and dancing line, with the overly simple textures and low poly texture.</P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</p>

  <P>Based on the visuals sharing similarities to various mobile games, this encourages people who like the addictive nature of mobile games to keep playing and keep browsing around the 3D assets like a puzzle. I feel that I am free in how I want to interact with this experience, and that I can have fun in this space. I am able to have fun and try to find different things to click on 3D models and more buttons to see where it will take me. Animations are open to just admire and observe in how they animate different items. </P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</p>

  <P>The Space is calming and relaxing from its bright colours and use of a dreamy atmosphere, which is intended to make users feel welcomed and accepted. The visuals that derive other mobile games like monument valley and dancing line allows for users to be comfortable and more familiar in how they interact with the environment, thus enhancing their experience and enjoyment. </P>

  <p class="subheadings"> 12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</p>

  <P>The most frustrating part of the interaction was there were times where I didn’t know where to click because of how overwhelming the visuals are and also not knowing which objects were interactable. There were no clear indicators of where to click so I had to guess most of the time. Also, the important buttons were situated at the side, which is not too noticeable compared to the cute visuals so it would be nice if they incorporated it into their 3D world more naturally and more noticeable.</P>

  <P class="subheadings"> 13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</P>

   <p>The most satisfying part of the experience was the feeling of such achievement when coins erupt after you shoot the ball into the goal. The mouse interaction with the floating island had a smooth animation and was fun to maneuver.  Lastly, the scrolling mechanic where small bits of information and words pop out whether you scroll down was a nice detail. Personally, it made the information more digestible and made my experience more satisfying. </p>
